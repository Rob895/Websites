<B>Why?:</B><BR><BR>
<strong>There has never been a better time to take up playing a woodwind instrument.</strong> Now, there is an abundance of reasonable 
quality and affordable saxophones and clarinets, and an internet search reveals a vast and diverse range of 
musical repertoire and playing opportunities. I hope you enjoy and are inspired by the collection of clips below.<br>

<B>Testimonials:</B><BR><BR>


"Rob is an extremely accomplished musician who teaches my 12 year old son the Saxophone.
 
Tom finds him a calm, patient and inspirational teacher and his playing has improved enormously under Rob's expert tuition.
 
Rob imparts his musicality and knowledge in a way that goes far beyond the weekly lessons."<BR>
Nicola Sangster<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>


"Rob taught my daughter the clarinet for several years up to grade 5. The lessons were very enjoyable as Rob ensured 
a variety of music and also encouraged playing duets to improve confidence. I would recommend Rob to pupils of any age or ability." <BR>
BH Tunbridge Wells<BR><BR><BR><BR>

"Rob has been a fantastic saxophone teacher. I started with him as an older student one year ago at level zero-no sight reading-no anything. Through his skill, patience, encouragement and enthusiasm, he has imparted to me, not only the ability to play the saxophone, but also a love and appreciation for the instrument and the music it can create.
In addition to continuing with my lessons, I now also play in a band and am able to enjoy the sociable aspects of the experience. Rob has a great balance and use of abundant knowledge, immense experience and aptitude. You inspire me Rob! Thank you!

"Rob has been my saxophone teacher for about 18 months and I have really enjoyed (and continue to enjoy) my lessons with him.  He is very patient, thorough and explains things well.  We work on a range of music and I am set realistic goals to achieve, so I feel as if I am progressing.   I can thoroughly recommend him as a music teacher. "<BR>
SW Heathfield<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>


"I'd been playing a few years but had got stuck and felt I needed help, not just with tone and technique, but with accurately reading jazz.  Rob's lessons have been great. He's endlessly patient and hugely knowledgable.  And fun."<BR>
RDS Ticehurst<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>


"As an elderly person, I made an attempt to teach myself to play the clarinet, this was not successful.  My thoughts turned to lessons, and I made an enquiry at Bonners and they gave me Rob's business card.  Rob encouraged me from the start and under his guidance and expert tuition over the last fourteen weeks has seen much improvement in my playing and understanding of music. The lessons are most enjoyable."<BR>
Roger Eastbourne<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>


"I would highly recommend Rob Sansom as a teacher of young students. He is friendly, approachable, and makes learning fun and accessible. My daughter's clarinet playing has progressed significantly in the 6 months she has been learning with Rob. Lessons include duet playing, improvisation and she is encouraged to bring along music which is relevant and interesting to her. Now she is keen to learn, looks forward to her lessons and, crucially, practises!"<BR>
BC Eastbourne<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>


"Since taking lessons from Rob my playing has improved dramatically. His knowledge of different styles of music (jazz, blues, classical and rock) combined with his creative approach to learning and teaching has meant my playing has come on in leaps and bounds. Through his support and encouragement he has persuaded me to join a band; something never thought I would do.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone taking saxophone lessons." <BR>
AndyT Eastbourne<BR><BR><BR><BR>

"Rob taught my son both clarinet and saxophone to grade 5 level and worked on his GCSE performance piece for which he received A* grading which was just brilliant!  I took the plunge as a parent to see if Rob could teach me to play the flute.  I am so pleased to report that I am taking weekly lessons and loving it.  Rob is patient beyond belief. He creates an ideal learning environment for both children and adults. I would highly recommend him and feel so happy to be finally at my age learning to play beautiful flute music.  Thanks Rob.   Maggie" <BR>
